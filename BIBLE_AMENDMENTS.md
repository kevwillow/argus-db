# Argus — Bible Amendments Log

This file is the audit trail for every in-place edit to `PROJECT_BIBLE.md`. Per user instruction (MAC-1 comment [5d75988d](/MAC/issues/MAC-1#comment-5d75988d-c267-4e0d-982c-0007a6f2fa36) on 2026-05-04):

- Every in-place bible edit pairs with an amendment-log entry.
- Sub-agent-level rule additions and interpretive guidance also go here, even when they do not modify the bible text itself.
- Each amendment entry must link the git commit that applied the change.

**SAR convention.** A "SAR" (Sub-Agent Rule) entry captures interpretive guidance, clarifications, or rules that bind one or more sub-agents but do not warrant editing the bible text. Use a SAR when the bible's existing wording is correct as written and the additional guidance is contextual, illustrative, or operational rather than contractual. SAR entries live in the **Sub-agent rule additions and interpretive guidance** section below, are numbered SAR-1, SAR-2, …, and identify the sub-agent(s) they bind.

The bible itself is the contract; this file is the changelog.

## Correction Pass 1 — Talos export integration

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Commit:** `26e44a3` — `docs(bible): correction pass — Talos export schema, severity mapping, false-positive guards`
**Source:** MAC-1 user comment [ab234b68](/MAC/issues/MAC-1#comment-ab234b68-9876-4ee9-9eb4-f2d9c3d0a7d8)
**Status:** Acknowledged and approved by user in MAC-1 comment [5d75988d](/MAC/issues/MAC-1#comment-5d75988d-c267-4e0d-982c-0007a6f2fa36)

### Corrections applied

1. **§4.4 (new)** — Talos export type-mapping table. `oui`/`mac`/`bssid`/`ssid_exact`/`ble_uuid` direct-pass; `ble_service`→`ble_uuid`; `ssid_pattern`/`device_fingerprint` dropped; `mac_range` expanded only if ≤256 entries; coverage report tallies the drops.
2. **§4.5 (new)** — Severity derived from `device_category`, NOT from confidence. high: imsi_catcher / alpr / covert_cam / hacking_tool / gps_tracker / face_recog. med: drone_detect / body_cam / drone. low: police_radio / gunshot_detect. Procurement-only records never exported to Talos.
3. **§7.5** — Talos-export per-record description format: ≤80 chars, no URLs, no "see source", `{vendor} {product family} ({short context})`; truncation falls back to `{category} device`.
4. **§8.4** — `device_category='unknown'` never exported to Talos under any confidence level. Pi self-exclude OUI list hard-coded: `b8:27:eb`, `dc:a6:32`, `e4:5f:01`, `28:cd:c1` (banned from high-confidence export; allowed in standard at `severity=low` only).
5. **§7.3 + §7.4** — Enumerated fake-MAC reject list: RFC 7042 IPv4 (`00:00:5e:00:53:00`–`ff`) and IPv6 (`02:00:5e:10:00:00:00:01`–`ff`) doc ranges, common patterns (`aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`, `de:ad:be:ef:*:*`, `ca:fe:ba:be:*:*`, `ba:db:00:b5:*:*`, all-zero, all-ones, etc.), all-identical-octet MACs, strictly monotonic +1 octet sequences. Validator routes matches to `conflicts` with `reason='known_fake_pattern'`.
6. **§7.3** — LAA-bit confidence penalty: scraped MACs with the locally-administered bit set (bit 1 of the first octet) get `confidence ≤ 40` and a `lab_bit_set` note unless the source explicitly attests broadcast use. (See sub-agent rule below for the corrected interpretation of the example list.)
7. **§6 Phase 3** — New Step-0 WiGLE budget estimate; new 🛑 **Checkpoint 3a** sub-checkpoint blocks WiGLE queries until human approves the budget plan.
8. **§7.5** — Talos export JSON file shape: `_meta` block (`argus_version`, `exported_at`, `record_count`, `confidence_threshold`, `argus_run_id`, `source_record_count`, 7-key `dropped_in_export`); `entries` shape with `argus_record_id` stable across re-runs for downstream upsert semantics.
9. **§11** — New hard-rules don'ts: #12 (Pi OUI ban from high-conf), #13 (`unknown` category never exported), #14 (procurement-only never exported). #11 left as a `(reserved)` placeholder to keep the user-prescribed numbering of #12/#13/#14 stable.
10. **§9** — Deliverables expanded to 5 files; new item 9 requires "Dropped from Talos export" tally that reconciles `source_record_count − sum(dropped) = entries.length` against the §7.5 `_meta.dropped_in_export` keys.

### Internal-consistency reconciliations applied during the read

- **§6 Phase 5 step 5 file descriptions** were stale relative to §9 item 2; updated to match (`argus_export.json` = "all confidences ≥30, applies §4.4/§4.5"; `argus_export_high_confidence.json` = "confidence ≥70").
- **§7.5 Don'ts** wording for the confidence floor was ambiguous; reworded to "do not export <30 to *any* Talos export file" so the §9 item 2 ≥30 floor is enforced everywhere.

### §12 Open Questions impact

Resolved by this pass (struck through in §12):
- Confidence threshold for default scanner export → 70 high-conf, 30 standard.
- Output file naming → `argus.db`, `argus_export.json`, `argus_export_high_confidence.json`, `argus_export.csv`.

New open question added by Correction 8 review:
- Does Talos's seeder need to support `argus_record_id` stable-id upsert in v0.2, or can re-imports be destructive (drop-and-reload)?

## Correction Pass 2 — §11 #11 placeholder filled with bible-amendment-log discipline

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Commit:** _(filled in by the commit that applies this entry)_
**Source:** MAC-1 user comment [f08cd82b](/MAC/issues/MAC-1#comment-f08cd82b-747e-4b34-aa6a-11bbfd0cc067) decision #4
**Status:** Applied as a normal in-place edit; logged here per §11 #11 (now self-binding).

### Correction applied

1. **§11 #11** — replaced the `(reserved)` placeholder with:

   > **Do not skip the `BIBLE_AMENDMENTS.md` log entry when making in-place bible edits or adding sub-agent-level rules.** The git diff is the source of truth, but the amendment log is the human-readable trail. An undocumented amendment is a process violation regardless of whether the edit itself is correct.

   This makes BIBLE_AMENDMENTS discipline a Critical Don't, on par with the other §11 hard rules. Numbering of #12/#13/#14 is unchanged (placeholder fill, not insertion).

### Why this is a single-entry pass

This pass touches a single line of bible text. The user explicitly authorized it as a one-line correction (decision #4 of the f08cd82b sign-off) and asked that it nonetheless be logged here so the meta rule is itself documented under the very discipline it codifies — preserving the audit-trail invariant from heartbeat zero.

### §12 Open Questions impact

None. §12 unchanged.

## Sub-agent rule additions and interpretive guidance

This section captures rules that bind sub-agents but do not edit the bible text. New entries append below; do not rewrite history.

### SAR-1 — §7.3 LAA-bit examples are illustrative, not exhaustive

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Source:** MAC-1 user comment [5d75988d](/MAC/issues/MAC-1#comment-5d75988d-c267-4e0d-982c-0007a6f2fa36)
**Bible commit:** none (no edit required)
**Binds:** Extraction Worker (§7.3), Validator (§7.4), DB Architect when wiring fake-MAC checks

The §7.3 LAA-bit examples (`02:*`, `06:*`, `0a:*`, `ae:*`) are a partial illustrative set, **not** an exhaustive list. The governing rule is **"bit 1 of the first octet is set"** — i.e., the first octet's least-significant bit pair `xxxxxx1x`. Implementations MUST test the rule directly:

```python
def has_laa_bit(mac_first_octet: int) -> bool:
    return bool(mac_first_octet & 0b00000010)
```

Any first-octet value where `(octet & 0x02) != 0` is locally-administered (e.g. `02`, `06`, `0a`, `0e`, `12`, `16`, `1a`, `1e`, …, `ae`, …, `fe`). Do NOT hard-code the four-prefix list.

### SAR-2 — Talos `argus_record_id` upsert semantics: human's lean is upsert

**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Source:** MAC-1 user comment [5d75988d](/MAC/issues/MAC-1#comment-5d75988d-c267-4e0d-982c-0007a6f2fa36)
**Bible commit:** none (no edit; tracked in §12 already)
**Binds:** DB Architect (when designing `argus_record_id` stability), future Export Worker, downstream Talos design

The user's stated lean for the open question on Talos v0.2 upsert semantics is **upsert** (preserves user-side annotations on Talos when re-importing later Argus versions). The final answer is a Talos design call and is not yet authoritative. Argus implementation should:

- Keep `argus_record_id` stable across re-exports of the same canonical record (already required by §7.5).
- Assume upsert is the likely target so the export shape and the Talos seeder contract converge.
- Surface this assumption explicitly at Checkpoint 5 if Talos design has not formally resolved it by then.
